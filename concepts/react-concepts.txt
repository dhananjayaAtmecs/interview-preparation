1. Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings

Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. 
However, they donâ€™t need to be globally unique. We can use the same 
keys when we produce two different arrays

2. reconciliation.

When the state of your component changes, the render function will return a new tree 
of React elements, different to the previous/current one. React needs to figure out 
what are the differences to efficiently update the UI with the most recent changes. 
This process of matching both element trees is called reconciliation.
